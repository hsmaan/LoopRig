\title{Finds elements within loops scaffolded by another set of elements}
\usage{
ScaffoldElements(loop_ranges, element_ranges_x, element_ranges_y,
  range_out_x = FALSE, range_out_y = FALSE, overlap_threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{loop_ranges}{A single \emph{LoopRanges} object that has been subset to one range through ConsensusLoops().}

\item{element_ranges_x}{The first element ranges to be considered. If using an 'ElementRanges' class object, subset by using list indexing.}

\item{element_ranges_y}{The second element ranges to be considered. If using an 'ElementRanges' class object, subset by using list indexing.}

\item{range_out_x}{A boolean indicating if the output should be a subset element ranges object for element_ranges_x instead of the default dataframe. (default = FALSE)}

\item{range_out_y}{A boolean indicating if the output should be a subset element ranges object for element_ranges_y instead of the default dataframe. (default = FALSE)}

\item{overlap_threshold}{Single numerical input for significant base-pair overlap to be considered 'overlapping'. Default is 1 base-pair.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe indicating scaffold linked elements in the form of their first metadata columns and the loop IDs for their scaffolds. The element_ranges_x (scaffold) are always under column 1, and element_ranges_y (links) are always under column 2.
}
\description{
Using a finalized \emph{LoopRanges} loops object and two sets of elements, determines which loops are 'anchored' by the first set of elements (x) and finds which elements from the second set (y) are within these loops.
